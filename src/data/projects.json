Using the principles of forced convection and conduction, the module could replace the end-cover of any motor, providing superior heat dissipation leading to a potential performance increase of 2X the rated continuous torque. This cost effective solution weighed less than 1kg, cost less than $300 to produce, and added less than 50mm of length to the backside of the motor.",
